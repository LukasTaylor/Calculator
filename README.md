# Calculator
## Description
This project contains the necessary logic to perform basic arithmetic on integer values. It's a basic calculator that supports operations of the following types: division(/), multiplication(*), addition(+), subtraction(-), and exponentation(^).

This calculator doesn't allow you to input your own decimal numbers for calculation.
## Run
To run this calculator and get correct output you must simply download the .jar file and run it. Then double click the file and the GUI should appear. By clicking the buttons on the GUI you can select numbers 0 - 9, and the earlier stated operators to perform basic arithmetic. 

One thing you must do is put a space between every operand and operator. For example, you must input your expression in the following form ( 88 ^ 2 ). If you don't follow this one simple rule you're likely to get an improper solution for your expression.
